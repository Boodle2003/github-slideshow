I love playing video games! Especially Xbox and Nintendo!
My favorite foods are burgers and pizza!
I like listening to rock music.
I don't like doing much yard work. I am comfortable with mowing the lawn, though.
I am currently working as an animator, voice actor, game programmer and musician. I don't have an organization or band yet, but I am looking to initiate one!
