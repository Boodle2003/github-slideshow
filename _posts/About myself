Let me tell you a little bit about myself...

I love playing video games! Especially Xbox and Nintendo!

My favorite foods are burgers and pizza!

I like listening to rock music.

I don't like doing much yard work. I am comfortable with mowing the lawn, though.

I am currently working as an animator, voice actor, game programmer and musician.
